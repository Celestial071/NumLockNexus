# NumLockNexus
NumLockNexus happens to be a security project (a very basic one). This system Takes your phonenumber and then provides you the password of the vault which can be accessed only by the given password


Required Items:
1. LCD display with I2C
2. Numpad
3. IR sensor
4. Servo Motor (for locking)\
5. Node MCU (to send server request to twilio).

I will soon provide a circuit diagram and the image of the project. Thank you.
Note :-- This combined with My simple parking management system was able to get a honorable mention in the nation competion "LOCUS".
